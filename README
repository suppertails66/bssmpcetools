This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English translation project for the PC-Engine CD game Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort. You'll need GCC and libpng, as well as any dependencies of wla-dx.

You'll first need a disc image of Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon for the PC-Engine CD. The Redump-verified image is highly suggested, though other images may work if they're a close enough match.

  Redump name: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon
  CRC32:       b318d9c2
  MD5:         86a30b952b5bd70b1212f92fcca886a4
  SHA-1:       868a40278c4e4ef2da9fa082dbdbba88966ea8c0

The disc image must be in ISO+WAV+CUE format. If you need to convert from a different format, try using bchunk.

Once you have an ISO+WAV+CUE image, rename the files such that every track is named as "bssm_01.wav", "bssm_02.wav", and so on up through "bssm_24.iso". Copy these files into the "bssmpce" directory. Then:

$ cd bssmpce
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated ISO for track 24 as "bssm_24_build.iso". Use the provided "bssm_iso_build.cue" CUE sheet to run the built disc.

The translation can be compiled with or without Japanese honorifics and terminology. This is controlled by the "HONORIFICS_FLAG" environment variable. Set it to 0 (or empty) for no honorifics, or nonzero to include them -- i.e. if you want honorifics, build with the command "HONORIFICS_FLAG=1 ./build.sh". This will also cause the original Japanese versions of images to be used instead of the translated versions.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources that get inserted into the game are coming from.

is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
