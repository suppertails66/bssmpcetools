145,,,,"(e492-e492a)","An unused scene of Past Wiseman during the ending:"
146,,,,"(e493, e495, e496)","These are unused lip flaps for the scrolling {Star Power} images in the ending."
147,,,,"(e510, e511, e517)","It also seems that several scenes in the ending were intended to scroll vertically."
148,,,,"(e510, e511, e517)","Note that the top and bottom halves don't meet evenly. That's just how they are."
149,,,,"(e520-e520a)","Some additional facial expressions for Naru in the ending:"
150,,,,"(e523-e523c)","An animation of Naru swinging her bag:"
151,,,,"(e524-e524c)","Usagi and Naru walking:"
152,,,,"(e532-e532a)","Unused lip flaps for Naru's angry response to Usagi's teasing:"
153,,,,"(e533-e533a, e534)","An additional, mostly-finished scene for the ending."
154,,,,"(e533-e533a, e534)","This was intended to more smoothly introduce the other +Senshi+Soldiers+ into the scene, like so:"
155,,,,"(e533-e533a, e534)","The first shot was probably meant to scroll into the second."
156,,,,"(e533-e533a, e534)","Since the scene isn't finished, the images' palettes aren't compatible, so we can't actually do that here."
157,,,,"(e546a, e547a)","Unused lip flaps for Usagi's close-ups in the ending:"
158,,,,"(e553)","The game contains unfinished versions of each +Senshi+Soldier+'s attacks."

179,,,,"(e725)","A different, and frankly better-looking, shot of Mercury after leaving the digital world."
180,,,,"(e725)","Here's the used shot, for comparison."
181,,,,"(Message)","And that's all for Ami. Now for Rei's handful of unused images:"

187,,,,"(Message)","Now for Makoto."
188,,,,"(e807b, e807c)","Shot of Makoto and the delinquents. Almost the same as the used version, with slightly different colors."
189,,,,"(e807b, e807c)","Has two frames, both of which are identical."
190,,,,"(e807d)","Kiyomi peering out from behind Makoto."
191,,,,"(e807d)","This and several other unused pictures show Kiyomi with brown hair,"

198,,,,"(e835e-e835f)","Two duplicate frames of a used shot of Makoto looking at the letter."
199,,,,"(e835e-e835f)","Not particularly interesting, but they suggest an additional animation was planned and scrapped."
200,,,,"(e835e-e835f)","Perhaps Makoto was going to react more visibly during her exclamation at the end of the scene."
201,,,,"(e836b)","One of several unused shots of Makoto and Kiyomi on the park bench."
202,,,,"(e836b)","This one differs from a used image only by coloring Kiyomi's hair a slightly brighter shade of pink."
203,,,,"(e836d)","This more interesting shot has Kiyomi putting her head on Makoto's shoulder."
204,,,,"(e838a)","An extra scene of Makoto accepting Kiyomi's cookies..."
205,,,,"(e838b)","...and reacting poorly to them."
206,,,,"(e839d)","An unused frame of Balm EX's {taunt} animation. Probably left out by accident."
207,,,,"(e841a-e841b)","Jupiter with her mouth open and radiating emphasis lines. The used version has her mouth closed."

215,,,,"(e917)","After giving up the initial search, we see the top of the castle at Dream Land..."
216,,,,"(e917a)","...then shift down to a view of Minako and Artemis on a bench."
217,,,,"(e918)","Someone reacting in surprise...I guess. Seems like the rest of the scene wasn't drawn."
218,,,,"(e918)","Most likely, Minako was supposed to hear a noise, think it was the {ghost}, and then go to investigate."
219,,,,"(e918)","In the finished game, Artemis simply justifies it with {we haven't checked this area yet}."
220,,,,"(e918-e918c)","Animation of Artemis climbing onto Minako's shoulder."
221,,,,"(e922)","OOPS"
222,,,,"(e926)","Minako chatting with Megumi just after they meet."
223,,,,"(e926)","The artist mistakenly drew Minako in her casual outfit instead of her school uniform,"
224,,,,"(e926)","which is probably the reason it's not used."
225,,,,"(e929)","Left half of a {panning} shot of Dream Land..."

229,,,,"(e935c)","Minako probably fantasizing about Dream Land..."

237,,,,"(e960-e960e)","Unused shot of Venus's Crescent Beam blowing Kunzite's mask off."
238,,,,"(e970d)","This would have been used as Venus tries and fails to withstand Kunzite's attack."
239,,,,"(e983-e983b)","An unfinished animation of Venus throwing Kunzite. The final game simply cuts to him on the ground."
240,,,,"(e995)","This first frame of the {light barrier} animation wasn't used in the original game due to a bug."
241,,,,"(e995)","It's used in this translation due to that bug being fixed, though."
242,,,,"(e1012c)","Rei with her eyes closed, probably blinking in response to being surprised by Minako."
243,,,,"(e1122f-e1122g)","Minako reacting positively to something."
244,,,,"(e1131-e1131a)","Minako reacting even more positively to something!"
245,,,,"(e1319)","Minako lying in bed. Could've been used in any of the many scenes where that occurs."
246,,,,"(Message)","And wow, that's it for the unused graphics. Hope that was informative."
247,,,,"(Message)","Now, the game also has 125 unused sound files..."
248,,,,"(Message)","...but we didn't translate them and they're generally not that interesting anyway."
249,,,,"(Message)","I'm just going to play them all through in order, without commentary, for the sake of completeness."
250,,,,"(Message)","All right, here we go..."
