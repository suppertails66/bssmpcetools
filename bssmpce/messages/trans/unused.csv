10,,,,"(Message)","So, hi from the translation team, or more specifically from Supper, who did the hacking."
11,,,,"(Message)","Hope you've been enjoying the translation."
1101,,,,"(Message)","In the original game, you'd be getting sent to the final scene right now..."
1102,,,,"(Message)","...but this seemed like a good place to add some new bonus content, so here we are."
1103,,,,"(Message)","Want to watch the ending as normal, or have a look at unused materials from the game?"
1104,,,,,"Watch the ending"
1105,,,,,"Look at unused stuff"
1106,,,,,"Quit"
1107,,,,"(Message)","Every choice in this game has to have three options. It's a fact."
1108,,,,"(Message)","Alright then..."
12,,,,"(Message)","If you're here, you're presumably pretty dedicated. Or watching on YouTube like a sane person."
13,,,,"(Message)","This is a little (haha, that's a lie) special feature I added for the translation."
14,,,,"(Message)","When I was taking apart the game in preparation for the translation, I found some unused files."
15,,,,"(Message)","Actually, a LOT of unused files. Like, over 450 of them."
16,,,,"(Message)","For context, the game has 5,177 files total, so we're talking 9 to 10 percent of the game going unused."
17,,,,"(Message)","Needless to say, the developers had more planned for the game than they were able to realize."
18,,,,"(Message)","There was so much extra material that it seemed a shame to let it go to waste, so..."
19,,,,"(Message)","...I've put together this slideshow-demo reel thing to show it off."
20,,,,"(Message)","I hope this'll be of interest to a few of you out there."
21,,,,"(Message)","So then, let's start off with the most interesting of the bunch: unused ending scenes!"
22,,,,"(Message)","Apparently, you were supposed to get extra scenes in the ending depending on your character."
23,,,,"(Message)","These scenes are mostly complete, so it's not clear why they got cut."
2301,,,,"(Message)","Note that {mostly}. I've had to make small repairs here and there to get these to display properly."
24,,,,"(Message)","First up, {amiend.mes}."
25,,,,"(Message)","If you played as Ami, this would have showed up before Usagi and Naru's scene in the ending..."
26,,,,"(Message)","A simple lead-in to the +Senshi's+Soldiers'+ sudden appearance in the ending. More on that later."
27,,,,"(Message)","Next, {reiend.mes}."
28,,,,"(Message)","Like with Ami's scene, this would come up before Usagi and Naru's bit if you played as Rei."
29,,,,"(Message)","...And that's all. Yep. Not much to it."
30,,,,"(Message)","Makoto's scene, {makoend.mes}, is more interesting. This would show directly before the credits..."
31,,,,"(Message)","The last two images in the scene were apparently drawn at the wrong size."
32,,,,"(Message)","In fact, they were originally programmed to display as full-screen pictures, despite being window-size."
33,,,,"(Message)","I had to modify the script to make them not show up as garbage."
34,,,,"(Message)","Anyway, last comes Minako, who has not one but two scenes: {minend1.mes} and {minend2.mes}."
35,,,,"(Message)","Here's {minend1.mes}, which would have appeared before Usagi and Naru's scene..."
36,,,,"(Message)","And {minend2.mes}, which would have appeared before the credits..."
37,,,,"(Message)","These extra scenes would have offered better (i.e. any) resolution to the side characters' subplots."
38,,,,"(Message)","Instead, they just awkwardly vanish halfway through the game. Oh well."
39,,,,"(Message)","Next, let's take a look at the unused graphics. There are over 300 of these, so buckle up..."
40,,,,"(Message)","Files will be presented roughly chronologically (largely the same as their internal numbering)."
41,,,,"(Message)","We'll cover Usagi's route and common material for all characters first."
42,,,,"(e75c-e75d)","An alternate animation for Usagi turning right instead of left after playing Sailor V Game."
43,,,,"(e77)","A grayed-out image of one of Luna's appearances at Crown."
44,,,,"(e77)","Why it's gray, I don't know. Even without that, it doesn't quite match either of the used pictures. "
45,,,,"(e80a-e80d)","This sequence of Rei losing at a shoot-'em-up has some unfinished additional frames..."
46,,,,"(e116c-e116e)","A sketch version of Usagi's {DESTINY} scene with an extra frame of animation."
47,,,,"(e119)","A flashback to Nephrite's death scene from the anime..."
48,,,,"(e120)","...and another one. Not sure where these would have been used."
49,,,,"(e145-e145a)","An animation of Mercury talking during the +Senshi+Soldiers'+ training session."
50,,,,"(e145-e145a)","It was meant to appear over her comments about Jupiter's new attack:"
51,,,,"(Mercury)","Amazing...She's never done anything like this before."
52,,,,"(Mercury)","Her thunder is releasing electro-
magnetic waves powerful enough to influence gravity in the area..."
53,,,,"(e155)","What appears to be a flashback to Nephrite's first appearance in the game."
54,,,,"(e155)","It's placed in the middle of the images for Luna's elucidation of Usagi's cogent comments."
55,,,,"(e155)","Possibly unused because it didn't fit the scene's pacing? Or just because it looks awkward."
56,,,,"(e161-e161a)","An unused shot of Makoto responding to one of Usagi's pleas to trust Nephrite."
57,,,,"(e167a)","Alternate version of the scene where Usagi tells Makoto she's not intruding on her date with Mamoru."
58,,,,"(e167a)","This shot has them reacting in surprise to something (Umino?)."
59,,,,"(e172)","An alternate, unfinished version of the {let Chiba deal with it} option for handling Umino..."
60,,,,"(e179-e179d)","...which is based on the one for Makoto, and includes a proper animation!"
61,,,,"(e179-e179d)","The used version is just a single static image."
62,,,,"(e185)","A shot of the visiting party outside Naru's place."
63,,,,"(e193)","An additional shot of Naru spotting Umino outside her door."
64,,,,"(e199-e199a, e201)","Some additional illustrations for the scene where Nephrite identifies Mamoru as Tuxedo Mask:"
65,,,,"(Nephrite)","...You're Tuxedo +Kamen+Mask+."
66,,,,"(Chiba)","?!"
67,,,,"(e207)","Sketch of an image that would have been used as Makoto leaves Usagi and Mamoru after visiting Naru."
68,,,,"(e215)","A (poorly colored) sketch of the +Shitennou+Four Heavenly Kings+."
6801,,,,"(e215)","This would have appeared at the start of Nephrite's flashback dream sequence:"
69,,,,"(Kunzite)","Prince...!"
70,,,,"(Zoisite)","Prince!"
71,,,,"(Nephrite)","Prince!"
72,,,,"(Jadeite)","Prince!"
73,,,,"(Kunzite)","Prince! We're sick of doing their bidding!"
74,,,,"(e219-e219f)","This is one of the more notable unused animations:"
75,,,,"(e219-e219f)","It shows Nephrite breaking off the fragment of the Black Crystal that later becomes the crux of the plot."
76,,,,"(e219-e219f)","This would have shown up after Nephrite's dream sequence, when he declares it's {too late now}."
77,,,,"(e234a)","The unused right half of the first-person shot of Nephrite being choked by Kunzite."
78,,,,"(e485a)","This is an alternate version of the +Senshi+Soldiers'+ {arrival on the scene} at Naru's house:"
79,,,,"(e485a)","Unlike the used scene, this version has their mouths opened."
80,,,,"(e485a)","Most likely, this would have been displayed for the final {We'll punish you!} line."
81,,,,"(e238-e238f)","The brief fight at Naru's house has an unused full-screen animation of Mercury activating her visor."
82,,,,"(e238-e238f)","The surrounding scene is provided for context:"
83,,,,"(Sailor Moon)","Whoa?! Hot-hot-hot!"
84,,,,"(Mercury)","(Wait...This flame isn't as hot as it should be.)"
85,,,,"(Mercury)","Don't be fooled, girls! It's an illusion!"
86,,,,"(e238-e238f)","It's a very nice-looking animation and totally finished, so it's surprising that it went unused."
87,,,,"(e238-e238f)","Maybe someone felt like the switch to full screen broke up the scene's pacing too much."
88,,,,"(e252b)","An unused lip flap animation for Makoto during the Dark Kingdom's takeover of Tokyo."
8801,,,,"(e1309)","An alternate version of Nephrite's {emerald gate} scene, with some very odd hair colors."
8802,,,,"(e1310)","And yet another version of the same thing!"
89,,,,"(e255)","A shot of Usagi leaning on a playground bar during the Dark Kingdom takeover."
90,,,,"(e255)","This is what she's meant to be leaning on in the scene where Makoto reassures her."
9001,,,,"(e1307)","The same thing from Makoto's perspective."
91,,,,"(e256-e256a)","An unfinished animation of a worried Rei talking (probably to Usagi in the preceding scene)."
92,,,,"(e262b)","Unused lip flaps for Minako."
93,,,,"(e264)","Next, materials for a scene that was apparently meant to occur just before the monuments appear..."
94,,,,"(e264)","Umino has been knocked to the ground."
95,,,,"(e265-e265c)","He gets up, confused..."
96,,,,"(e265d-e265f)","...looks around..."
97,,,,"(e265g-e265i)","...and sees something shocking overhead!"
98,,,,"(e267)","An emphatic shot of Queen Beryl intended to show at the climax of her summoning ritual."
99,,,,"(e271)","The apparitions of the Dark Kingdom, but without the city backdrop."
100,,,,"(e272)","A shot of the city's energy being drained..."

102,,,,"(e273)","Artemis reacting to the Dark Kingdom takeover."
103,,,,"(e274)","Luna doing the same."
104,,,,"(e293)","Naru reacting to the glowing fragment of the Black Crystal in her hand."
105,,,,"(e293)","The finished game cuts directly to a view of the fragment in her palm instead."
106,,,,"(e296)","The next images are for a scrapped scene following the Dark Kingdom's takeover."
107,,,,"(e296)","A flower grows on the ground..."
108,,,,"(e296a)","...but withers after its energy is drained."
109,,,,"(e296b)","The +Senshi+Soldiers+ teleport in."
110,,,,"(e297-e297e)","This first image is actually used in the game; however, it was originally part of a longer animation..."
111,,,,"(e297-e297e)","...showing Usagi bending over to gaze sorrowfully at the wilted flower."
112,,,,"(e298)","Closeup of the flower."
113,,,,"(e311)","Sailor Moon reacting to Beryl's appearance during their confrontation."
